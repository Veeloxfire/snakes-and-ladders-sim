# Snake and ladders
I got bored one day watching this video: https://youtu.be/k2ixp5VozIs?si=EIiU4Xsh51LQ0R5I
The question: how long would take to play a game of snakes and ladders with only snakes (every ladder is also a snake)

This does not take into account the "roll for 6" rule to begin the game

# The answer
A simulation of 1000000 games

average turns: 555.778748
best took: 20 turns
worst took: 8370 turns

If you can roll every 10 seconds it would take you on average 1.5 hours to finish the game
If you play the drinking game variant you will almost certainly perish before the game is over

# Comparison
For context the same simulation but with ladders correctly sending you up not down

average turns: 59.187389
best took: 7 turns
worst took: 774 turns

If you can roll every 10 seconds it would take you on average 10 minutes to finish the game
If you play the drinking game variant you would probably be fine (but there are some unfortunately long games)
